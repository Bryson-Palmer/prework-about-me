      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student in a coding bootcamp. I've been a stay-at-home Dad raising four kids for the last nine years. I am entering the web development industry for the first time and transitioning away from being the stay-at-home parent. I am so ready to learn something new and to get back into the community.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Kennewick, WA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a hobbyist musician for the last 26 years. I have been studying mixed martial arts and Brazilian jiu-jitsu for two years. I like to go camping with my family. We take lots of trips to national parks and Disney parks.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Being a studio musician, running a jiu-jitsu academy, or making content for either subject.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Richland, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like the coding languages and what one can do with them. It's a great balance of the logical and creative. There is so much to learn about web development yet the whole thing is still so relatively new. The web isn't going anywhere and there are lots of employment opportunities.
